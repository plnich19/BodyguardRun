This is my game project made in Unity.
The player can run toward automatically from the start, move left and right, and also jump.
The script is written in C# language. You can open it by using Microsoft Visual Studio.

1. Camera Motor script is a camera script. The camera will always follow the player.
2. Coin Collector script is about detection on coin when the player collects the coin. It will be gone and score will be increase by 10.
